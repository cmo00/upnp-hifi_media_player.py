# upnp-hifi_media_player.py
A terminal shell based python3 audio-player that streams audio files to connected network DACs (tested with one ifi and one Yamaha DAC). Also works with usb connected DACs. Developed while using LAN connection to the router (but should also work with WLAN). Features on-the-fly .aiff to .wav conversion (so far no .dsf support)
